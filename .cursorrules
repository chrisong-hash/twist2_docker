# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## File Generation
- NEVER create or generate files wihtout first confirming with the user
- The flow for file generation should be to tell the user the purpose of the file and ask for permission
- Favour telling the user over generating .md
- Favour telling the commands and step over generating .sh

## File Preservation
- Favour preserving old working files and creating separate files/directories instead of modifying existing ones
- When making significant changes, create new files with descriptive names (e.g., `_v2`, `_new`, or version numbers) rather than overwriting working code
- Consider creating backup copies or separate directories for experimental changes


## Starting Conversation
- Before generating anything, chat with the user to confirm the direction before proceeding
